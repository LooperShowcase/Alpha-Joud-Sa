        For other uses, see Motorcycle (disambiguation). Not to be confused with
        Motocycle. A classic Norton motorcycle 1952 Lambretta 125 D scooter A
        motorcycle (motorbike, bike, or, if three-wheeled, a trike) is a two or
        three-wheeled motor vehicle steered by a handlebar from a saddle-style
        seat.[1][2][3] Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of
        different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport
        (including racing), and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a
        motorcycle and being involved in other related social activities such as
        joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies. The 1885
        Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in
        Germany was the first internal combustion, petroleum-fueled motorcycle.
        In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfm√ºller became the first series production
        motorcycle.[4][5] Globally, motorcycles are comparably popular to cars
        as a method of transport. In 2021, approximately 58.6 million new
        motorcycles were sold around the world,[6] fewer than the 66.7 million
        cars sold over the same period.[7] In 2022, the top four motorcycle
        producers by volume and type were Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, and
        Suzuki.[8] In developing countries, motorcycles are considered
        utilitarian due to lower prices and greater fuel economy. Of all the
        motorcycles in the world, 58% are in the Asia-Pacific and Southern and
        Eastern Asia regions, excluding car-centric Japan.[citation needed]
        According to the US Department of Transportation, the number of
        fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was 37 times
