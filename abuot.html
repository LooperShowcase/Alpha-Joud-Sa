      Motorcycling is an active sportâ€”and a sportbike is a perfect example.
      Designed to provide a direct connection between rider and machine, it puts
      you in control. But a good sportbike is much, much more. It needs to offer
      both performance and ridability, along with power and reliability, plus
      suspension that gives you direct feedback while still remaining
      comfortable. Honda sportbikes have long been benchmark machines in their
      field, from our legendary CB750K0 to the models we offer today.
